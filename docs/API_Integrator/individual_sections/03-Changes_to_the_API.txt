# Changes to the API

## Overview

The API may evolve over time, with new fields being added to responses. This document outlines how to handle API changes and what to expect when updates occur.

## Example of API Evolution

A response might initially look like:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "item_id": 1,
  "item_name": "Cheez-its"
}
```

And later be expanded to include additional fields:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "item_id": 1,
  "item_name": "Cheez-its",
  "manufacturer": "Nabisco",
  "price_history": [
     {
       "price": 1.00
     }
  ]
}
```

## Best Practices

1. Your code should be designed to handle such additions gracefully
2. Always check for field existence before using it
3. Don't assume field order in responses
4. Monitor API changelog for updates
5. Test integrations regularly

## API Version Updates

The API version is indicated in the URL path. For example:
https://api.drx.com/v2/endpoint

When breaking changes are introduced, a new version number will be released. We maintain backward compatibility within the same major version number.

## Breaking Changes

Types of breaking changes include:
- Removal of deprecated endpoints
- Changes to request/response structures
- Authentication method updates

## Deprecation Notices

When features are scheduled for removal or major changes, we provide:
- Advance notice through the changelog
- Migration guides
- Timeline for deprecation
- Alternative endpoints or methods

## Changelog Access

You can access the full changelog at:
- API Dashboard
- Release Notes section
- Email notifications (for registered developers)

## Additional Notes on Evolving Fields

- New fields may be added at any time
- Existing fields maintain their data types
- Optional fields may become required in new versions
- Deprecated fields are marked in documentation
- Field names follow consistent naming conventions
